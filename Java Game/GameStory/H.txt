Sick of this nonsense, you decide to retrieve the chains yourself. You quickly tromp over to the forest and confront the figure.
Immediately regretting your decision you start backing away, but itâ€™s too late. Whatever this thing is, is definitely more
grotesque up close. Wretched stench fills your nostrils. Haggard teeth jet from dry and cracked lips wet with saliva. Nothing
but a small glimmer behind sunken eye sockets reflects the light of the moon. Two lanky arms sagging with loose flesh and
long hands with jagged nails outstretch in your direction. Skin dark as pitch and long dark hair knotted with twigs and mud.
Teeth sink into the soft midsection of your body and blood pours from your mouth like a fountain. Darkness shrouds your
vision and you begin to lose consciousness. Wrapped in warmth and at peace. There will be no awakening from this sleep.
