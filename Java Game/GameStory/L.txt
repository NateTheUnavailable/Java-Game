Jack suggests looking for a weapon. Well duh, what did he think, that you were digging through the debris of the house for fun? Ignoring him, you find a large hammer and a screwdriver under crumbling floorboards. Must've been a toolbox here. You take the lighter of the two and hand Jack the hammer. You throw a stained tablecloth over Julie and shove her in what looked like an old closet, hoping the creature doesn't find her. Readying yourselves, you hide behind tattered curtains while Jack hides behind the door.

The monster enters the doorway and takes a deep breath, inhaling your scent. It can taste you in the air. Lumbering closer and closer to you with each breath. Finally, it reaches you and lets out a horrific shrill. You assume this is its before kill screech. Quickly and forcefully you plunge the screwdriver deep into the soft midsection of the beast. It lets out a deafening scream and with a swing of its arm, it sends you flying. You crash through the wall and are thrown into the lawn.

You are unconscious.

Jack runs up from behind the creature and swings at its head, sending the monster stumbling to the ground. He bludgeons its head in and finishes the job. Stringy dark red blood pours from its head in a puddle on the floor, bubbling and burning through the floorboards.

You awaken in a hospital. Safe. You are surrounded by your friends and family. Too bad Robert couldnâ€™t be here. You have suffered a mild concussion but you will return home in a few hours. Sweet, sweet home.
