Too risky. Might as well just stay with your friends. You head back outside where your friends plan to tag the house. You
refuse to help tag so you decide to keep watch in case anyone decides to come up and rain on your parade. In the bushes,
something shiny catches your eye. The bright light of the moon illuminates a lanky shadowed figure just beneath the trees.
Your uneasy butterflies return and youâ€™re unsure what to do. The figure seems to be grinning now and your eyes have
focused.

The figure is holding the chains of your bikes!
