Later that night after you all ate you met up at Jack's house packed and ready to go. Of course, you told your parents that you are spending 
the night at Jack's house so your parents are obviously unaware of your intentions. As you hop on your bike to head to the allegedly haunted 
house on Maple Hill, butterflies swarm your stomach and climb your throat like a ladder.

Not the good kind.

These butterflies seem to be yelling, "Turn back! This is a bad idea!" You can't let your friends think you're a pansy and go home just yet. 
You ignore the vexing feeling and continue to pedal.

As you reach the house it is sunset and the house seems to have blazing red flames that are licking up the sides of the house sending chills 
down your spine. This is the only structure on the entire hill for miles and you are the only ones up there. The house looks intimidating and 
you hesitate before stepping off your bike to check the house out. Your friends are too busy on the lawn unpacking supplies discussing matters
of vandalism to notice you. Just before entering the house you notice a shadowy figure looking down at you from the second story window. The 
second you blink it vanishes. You want to tell your friends so they know what theyâ€™re getting into, but they'll probably just find it amusing 
and decide to check the house out anyway.

C.Tell Your friends
D.Keep It to yourself. It's just a ghost
