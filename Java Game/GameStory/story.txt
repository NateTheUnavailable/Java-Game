School is just getting out and your three best friends, Julie, Robert and Jack come running up to you yelling your name over 
one another as if they want to be the first to bring the news. “Mel! Mel! Mel! Guess what?” Their words spilled over each other 
and all you could make out was ‘sleepover’, 'out of town and' and ‘abandoned house’. You know exactly what house they are talking 
about and just the mention of it made you skeptical, but you had to hear them out.

Apparently, Jack's parents are out of town longer than they planned and that meant Vicky is going to be "watching"
after him when in reality she really doesn't give a damn what he does--worst babysitter in the world. Anyways, Jack 
is planning to have Julie, Robert and you over for a sleepover. Since his parents are out of town we would be able to 
get away with a lot more. Of course, Jack came up with the genius idea to have a sleepover and sneak out to the old 
abandoned house on Maple Hill. The old house on Maple Hill has been abandoned for decades and left to rot after the 
former couple was murdered in their sleep. The murderer was never caught and rumors say that is wasn't even a human that 
killed the couple. The legend is told that the beast that killed them wears all black and to this day still wanders in the 
woods waiting for mindless humans to venture their way right onto its menu. You thought, "Okay this is going to be fun. We'll 
explore and have a good time," but no that was not the case. Your ne'er-do-well friends had the idea to bring the spray paint 
and express themselves all over the old house. Something you were definitely not down to do, but you couldn't let them think 
you were a coward so you had to go.

Will You 

A.Go have a sleepover with your friends
