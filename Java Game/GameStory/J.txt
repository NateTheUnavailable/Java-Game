You decide to save yourself. Being the coward you are, you leave what’s left of your squad to save yourself. You look back to 
see the black figure staring at you like it had been before. Pausing for a bit, you are tempted to see what it’s going to do next.
Merely seconds later, the creature devours your last two friends in a vicious manner. Jake's screams echo in your mind still 
and to this day you have kept this a secret to everyone.
